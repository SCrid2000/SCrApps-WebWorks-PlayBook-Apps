This is the PlayBook version of the WebWorks Testing App. The BlackBerry 10 version is located in the PlayBook Apps repository.

One of the amazing thing about WebWorks is the versatility of HTML5. You can buy an expensive WYSIWYG editor, or you can code your documents in the Windows notepad or gedit or any other notepad program. Once the code is written, you can test it in probably hundreds, if not thousands, of browsers.
The WebWorks Testing app is just one more place for you to test your app, and probably one of the final testing spots before you deploy it to your BlackBerry PlayBook or BB10 device.

Setup:
Create your testing files and place them either on the web, on a home server, or on your PlayBook file system.
Compile the WebWorks Testing source into an app and sideload it. You can also sideload the precompiled .bar if you don't want to compile it, or download it from App World.
Launch the WebWorks Testing app, and follow the setup instructions.
That's it. You can test your WebWorks apps by just launching the WebWorks Testing app.

Thanks to BlackBerry, Tim Neil, and the rest of the team responsible for bbUI, which was used to improve the appearance of the settings screen.
